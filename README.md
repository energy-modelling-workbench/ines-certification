# ines-certify

Open certification process for energy system models

Placeholder for now - the intent is to create tooling to automatize the testing and validation of energy system models against tractable system tests. The system tests will be in an ines-spec conforming database and each model will transform the data to the model specific format using their own data transformers built with ines-tools.
